The Battleship Game in MATLAB

Battleship is a well-known paper-and-pencil game. The object of Battleship is to try to sink the computer's whole fleet of ships before the computer sinks yours. Computer's ships are somewhere on the computer's board, and you try to hit them by firing at one of the squares on the board. The computer will also try and hit your ships, which are placed on your board. Neither you nor the computer can actually see the other's ships, so you must figure out where they are. 

Our game will assume two 10×10 matrices where the ships can be laid out. The columns should have numbers 0 to 9, and rows (lines) should have the labels A through I. One matrix will be for the player’s ships, and the other will be for computer’s. Fleet layouts are taken from the file FleetLayouts.txt.
